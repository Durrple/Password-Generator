# Challenge-3: Creating a user prompted password generator
## Description:
  ## For challenge 3, I coded the javascript for this password generator. It uses window alerts to prompt the user on what types of characters the user would like included in their password. After completing the prompts, it generates a password based off the users responses, then relays the newly generated password onto the webpage, and into the alert window as well.
